# Millionaires Club Platform — Architecture Assessment v1

**Status:** First Assignment deliverable (Master Prompt v2.0, §48). [Founder Decision Gate #1](FOUNDER_DECISION_GATE_1.md) **Part A approved 2026-09-26**; Part B (MCTN, rewards, UMI principles) not yet decided.
**Progress:** Stage 2 (foundation) is built: PostgreSQL everywhere with migrations, test harness, append-only audit log, role-based access with database-backed sessions, staff MFA, encrypted off-site backups with a restore check, Content-Security-Policy, persistent rate limits, and real data out of the repository. What remains for Stage 2 is operational: switch the backups on in production and run the first restore check.
**Stage 3 (financial core) under way:** Money in integer cents, the loan calculation engine, and the double-entry ledger with database-enforced invariants are built (migration step M3). The chart of accounts waits for the accountant (A13); maker/checker approvals are built (switched on once officers are named, A4); new loans run on the engine (stored schedule, payout with the fee netted, daily delinquency, late fees switched off until counsel confirms, waivers and write-offs with checkers, postings once the chart is approved). Contributions are monthly dues obligations: payments cover the oldest month first, with numbered receipts, reversal with a checker, and arrears reporting. Next: opening balances (M4, needs A13 and A14), then dual-write (M5).

This assessment keeps the existing application and evolves it. It does not propose a rewrite. Every number cited comes from the current codebase and database (the seeded club data), or from the reproducible models in [`scripts/models/`](../../scripts/models/).

## Decision log

Each decision is written out in full, in the §49 format, in the linked document. "Legal" means the decision cannot be finalised without professional legal, tax or accounting review.

| ID | Decision (proposed) | Reversibility | Legal | Founder | Where |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-01 | Modular monolith now, with modules named for the target `mcfinance/` monorepo; split into apps / services / `web3/` in stages as each trigger is met | easy | no | yes | [10](10-data-api-repository.md#d-01) |
| D-02 | PostgreSQL in every environment; retire SQLite and the duplicate schema file | easy | no | no | [10](10-data-api-repository.md#d-02) |
| D-03 | Store money as integer cents; all arithmetic through one Money module | moderate | no | no | [04](04-contributions-loans-ledger.md#d-03) |

## Reproducing the numbers

```bash
node scripts/models/tokenomics.mjs   # §13 tokenomics tables
node scripts/models/umi.mjs          # §17 UMI funding tables
```

Both scripts use integer arithmetic and have no dependencies. Every assumption is a named constant at the top of the file.

## Independence

This architecture has no dependency on Olbos Technologies or any Olbos product, and nothing in the current codebase references one. Any future relationship with another organisation is a separate business decision.
